Real-World Example Flow
Example 1: A Manager sees that their department is lagging behind on DPR submission deadlines. The manager drills down into individual performance data and identifies that two field teams are consistently missing deadlines. The manager reassigns resources, sets new internal deadlines, and communicates the updated priorities to the teams.

Example 2: A Manager identifies an underperforming team with lower-than-expected accuracy in their task execution. They generate a custom report to assess individual performance, find the root cause, and initiate a targeted training program on accuracy.

This Manager Dashboard is designed to give managers a high-level view of their department or division's performance while providing the granularity needed to track tasks, resources, and employees. The dashboard empowers managers to make data-driven decisions, foster team growth, and ensure that goals are achieved effectively across the entire division.
