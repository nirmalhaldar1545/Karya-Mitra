Real-World Example Flow
Example 1: An HR Manager sees that Employee A's performance has been steadily declining over the last 3 months. They generate a report that includes employee feedback and task completion trends, which shows that Employee A has missed multiple deadlines. HR reaches out to the team leader for a one-on-one meeting to discuss potential support or corrective actions.

Example 2: The HR Team notices that Team B has a high turnover rate. Using analytics, they identify that employees in that team report low engagement and dissatisfaction with management. HR initiates an employee engagement survey and, based on the results, works with the team leader to implement changes to improve morale.

This HR Dashboard provides HR professionals with comprehensive tools to manage employee performance, track engagement, ensure organizational compliance, and make data-driven decisions. It enables HR teams to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and take proactive steps to improve overall employee satisfaction, retention, and performance.
